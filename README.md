## Info / Warning
Build at your own risk This design is unconfirmed. PAL dumps have been added, courtesy of tomatolicious on the Retro Dreams and Techy Things Discord group. I do not have the original board, so this is a rough layout, not exactly the same size since it uses socketed footprints. However, it does abide by the ISA standard height (121.92mm) and uses a readily available slot cover that would need to be drilled for the switch to fit through. Board may require some more work -- this is considered a non-functional alpha release.
